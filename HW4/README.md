### Instructions for Homework 4

You have create an mongodb for this. The database I'm using is stored in env variables in the backend/app.py file. You will need to create your own local mongoDB and use that to run the code.

To run the code for Homework 4, please follow these steps
1. If flask and pymongo are not installed, run pip install -r requirements.txt in the root file. I recommend using venv before running this
2. Turn on the local mongoDP
3. Run the app.py file in the HW4/backend folder with following command `python .\HW4\backend\app.py`.
4. Go to localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the web application.
5. Create an account and then go to the sign in page to sign in. !!! DO NOT USE YOUR USUAL PASSWORDS!!! They are stored in plain text in the database for simplicity as this is a school project.
6. Start creating cards at the top left add cards button
7. Cards will appear in the the flipcard page after creation
