### Instructions for Homework 2

To run the code for Homework 2, please follow these steps (I assume that flask and mysql-connector-python are installed):
1. Activate the venv with the command `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
2. Run the app.py file in the HW2/backend folder with following command `python .\HW2\backend\app.py`.
3. Go to localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the web application.
4. The index page will have the options to manage employees, departments, and projects.
5. You can add, update, delete employees, view departments and projects, and assign employees to projects.
